Modern businesses deal with huge amounts of complex information. IT teams require quick and efficient access to information on various systems, hardware, and software solutions.

Effective organization and streamlined UIs are critical. Whether debugging internal tools or responding to customer queries, speed is everything when it comes to accessing knowledge assets.

## What is a knowledge base?

A knowledge base is a dedicated platform for storing resources and documents. The goal is to give users a quick and easy way to find the information they need. This might include common queries, technical details, solutions to known problems, specifications, and more.

Of course, the contents of knowledge bases platforms vary from organization to organization.

Technology is changing constantly. It’s crucial that your knowledge base tool can be quickly and easily updated, to match the current needs of your business.

### Why do you need a knowledge base tool?

Effective knowledge bases help to ensure profitability across your entire organization. When information is disorganized, IT teams encounter excessive admin time, and scope for human error.

Many businesses manage knowledge using spreadsheets or shared documents. Others simply rely on team members knowing which colleague for knowledge sharing. This leads to inefficient processes, poor outcomes, and unnecessary operations costs.

Efficient IT teams are crucial for successful modern businesses. An effective knowledge base ensures that businesses can remain competitive, through streamlined processes - providing an easy way for customers and employees toa access information and answer frequently asked questions.

### What should an IT knowledge base contain?

Most knowledge bases are built around two parts:

* A database for storing information.
* A front-end interface for searching, accessing, viewing, and using this information.

Of course, specific database entries will vary from business to business. So will the length or format of entries. The key is ensuring that users can access, manipulate, and add information, with an intuitive employee or customer experience.

What works for a small business might not work for an enterprise though.

Some more advanced types of knowledge base systems will also have additional capabilities, like search functionality, communications, or integrations with other platforms.
