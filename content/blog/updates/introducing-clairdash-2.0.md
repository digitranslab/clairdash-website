Today we're launching Clairdash 2.0 - and yes, you can build your own custom components! Clairdash 2.0 brings it all together: extensibility, scalability, education, and community. We think you'll love it!

## Features & Improvements

### 🎨 Custom plugins (components and datasources)

By far our most requested feature - users can now add custom datasources and components, aka plugins, to Clairdash. Plugins are stored at the global level allowing you to use them across your different apps.

[Visit the docs for custom plugins](https://docs.clairdash.com/docs/custom-plugin)

### 🔌 Plugins repository

We've created a plugin repository to store plugins created by the community. We plan to put time and effort into growing this plugin ecosystem over the next few months - including our first hackathon.

[Visit the plugin repository](https://github.com/Clairdash/plugins)

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User groups

User groups are critical when you want to scale your Clairdash deployment. User groups are a collection of users who perform a similar task. For example, a group of marketing representatives might be put in a Marketing user group. When you add a user to a group, they are assigned the default permissions of that group.

### 🖇️ Binding groups

We’ve revamped the bindings drawer and nested all the user bindings under sections. This makes it much easier to navigate and find the values you are looking for.
