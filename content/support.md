Clairdash provides community support by default, but extended support is available for customers. 

---

#### Community support

As an open source platform, Clairdash offers community support to everyone. This includes responding to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Clairdash/clairdash/issues), answering [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Clairdash/clairdash/discussions), and chatting across a number of public channels on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZepTmGbtfF).

When interacting with community support you may receive help from either our Customer Success team, or another supportive community member. While this support is not obligated, the Clairdash team endeavours to answer what we can, and all community contributions are appreciated! 

The GitHub repository is a good place to look for FAQs.
